# Malware Classifier From Network Capture

*Malware Classifier* is a simple free software project done during an [university workshop of 4 hours](http://www.foo.be/cours/dess-20142015/Redis-Introduction.pdf). The objective of the 4 hours workshop was to introduce network forensic and simple techniques to classify malware network capture (from their execution in a virtual machine). So the software was kept very simple while using and learning existing tools (networkx, redis and Gephi).

## Notes for the student

Check the git log and the commits, these include the steps performed during the workshop especially regarding the improvement of the Python scripts.
